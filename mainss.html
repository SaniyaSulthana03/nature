    <h2>Importance of Nature</h2>
    <p>If not for nature then we wouldn't be alive.The health benefits of nature for humans are incredible.
        the most important thing for survival is oxygen.The entire cycle of respiration is regulated by nature.
        The oxygen that we inhale is given by trees and the carbondioxide we exhale is getting absorbed by trees.

   <p>The ecosystem of nature is a community in which producers ,consumers,and decomposers work together in their environment for survival.The natural fundamental processes 
    like soil creation,photosynthesis,nutrient cycling,and water cycling,allow earth 
    to sustain life.We are dependent on these ecosystem services daily whether or not we are aware.
