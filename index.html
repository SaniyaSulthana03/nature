    <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. 
        "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general.
    The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. 
    Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>

    <h2>What is nature and natural?</h2>
    <img src="nature.jpg" alt="natura">
    <p>Lightning strikes during the eruption of the Galunggung volcano, West Java, in 1982. The words nature and natural 
        are used for all the things that are normally not made by humans. 
        The word comes from the Latin natura meaning "birth". 
        Nature includes many things like weather, organisms, landforms, celestial bodies.</p>

            <li>Yet for children and adults alike, daily contact with nature-
                 being in green, open space, near healthy rivers, exploring nature's colours, sounds, tones and textures-
                 is linked to better health, less stress, better mood, reduced obesity. 
                That's already an amazing list of features no other product can ever match.</li>
            <li>It's easy to think nature will always be with us. But it depends on whether 
                we let nature go to the wall or act to repair,
                 restore and maintain it. Right now species are going extinct and the natural systems that support
                  all life on Earth are being eroded faster than ever before.
            </li>
            <li>Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; 
                however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for 
                numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears.
                 This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it.</li>
